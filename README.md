# Description
**VENVI** is a web app where users can find and submit user reviews for specific models of cars, as well as buy and sell cars. This app takes a different approach from the commonly seen critical reviews from cars, user reviews are also an important factor in influencing purchading decisions and we provide that. 

This app is built with React. The app is decoupled; the front end GitHub page can be found [here](https://github.com/PhillipChang/venvi-fe), while the back end page can be found [here](https://github.com/chloezhouny/venvi-be).
